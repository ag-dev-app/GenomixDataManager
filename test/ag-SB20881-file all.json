      "\n <p id = \"leftalign\">Do you feel like scratching yourself raw every time your neighbour's pet rubs past you? Have you ever wondered why your friend gets the sniffles every year during summer? Do you know allergies are a major cause of illnesses? Nearly 50 million Americans suffer from some form of allergy. An allergy is a hypersensitive immune reaction to an allergen that enters the body or comes in contact with it.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone with an allergy has an interesting story about how they discovered that their body reacted violently to seemingly harmless allergens. Once an allergy is triggered, the symptoms can range from being annoying to deadly. From an evolutionary angle, allergies provided an alarm that kept humans away from toxic chemicals, either from venomous animals or plants. The reaction from the body\u2019s immune system acted as a warning system that prompted our ancestors to move to other parts of the forest.</p>\n\n<p>The balance has shifted with modernisation where there is exposure to a lot of synthetic chemicals, leading to a rise in allergy incidences. Our ancestors moved to other parts of the forest to avoid an allergic reaction, however, we continue to be exposed due to the presence of allergens indoors.</p>\n\n<p>Some Interesting facts about genes and allergy.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Family and twin studies have shown that allergies are partly genetic</li>\n<li>A child with a parent with allergy is 3 to 6 times more likely to have asthma</li>\n <li>Food allergies lead to 150 to 200 fatalities every year in the U.S</li>\n<li>Allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S, with an annual cost of $18 million</li>\n<li>Allergic rhinitis affects 30% of the Indian population</li>\n<li>Nearly 80% of histamine intolerant patients are middle-aged</li>\n<li>Heritability for allergic diseases is estimated to be 95% for asthma, 84% for atopic dermatitis and 91% for allergic rhinitis</li>\n<li>Upto 70% of the variation in the risk for motion sickness is genetic</li></ul>\n\n<p>Gene variations are partly responsible for the risk of allergies. Other factors include environmental triggers, stress and the presence of gut microbes.</p>\n\n<p>In this report we profile genes that are associated with the risk for various indoor, outdoor and food allergies.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this report helps you understand your body better and you safeguard yourself from exposure to allergens based on your genes, to lead a healthier life.</p>"

      "\n\n<h4 class=\"text-center\" id = \"slabo\"><b>Human health is a complex interplay between genetics and the environment (lifestyle, diet, activity, stress, etc.). Your genes and the environment that you are exposed to, both play a vital role in your well-being.</b></h4>\n\n<p>This report is presented in a user friendly language and format. The following tips will help you get the best information value out of the report.</p>\n\n<p><b>1. The word \u201clikely\u201d is used often in the report. What does it mean?</b></p>\n<p>People generally know that high cholesterol can lead to heart conditions. However, there are individuals with high cholesterol who do not develop heart disease. Similarly, smoking can lead to lung disease, but not always. Hence, certain genetic parameters can lead to certain outcomes but other factors may modify the outcome. \u201cLikely\u201d means, it is more likely that one will see the outcome, but other factors may modify it.</p>\n<p><b>2. What does the term \u201cmoderate\u201d mean in the report?</b></p>\n<p>Moderate implies neither high nor low, rather an intermediate or an average outcome. For example, moderate likelihood of pets allergy is an intermediate level between high and low likelihood.</p>\n<p><b>3. How do I know which result is applicable to me?</b></p>\n<p>Only results with a check mark (\"\\u2713\") are applicable to you, the others are not applicable. All possible outcomes are provided in the table to provide a context to your outcome.</p>\n<p><b>4. Where did the information contained in the report come from?</b></p>\n<p>The genetic markers that are used in this report are based on scientific studies published in international journals. A list of references is available for you to read on our web blog.</p>\n<p><b>5. Some sentences are colored in green and others in red, why?</b></p>\n<p>Low risk for a specific allergy is indicated in green while high risk is in red. Moderate or Neutral outcomes are indicated in black.<br><br>\n<b>6. What is the difference between lactose intolerance and milk allergy?</b></p>\n<p>Lactose intolerance occurs due to insufficient amount of lactase enzyme, resulting in the inability to digest lactose, a sugar present in milk. Milk allergy, on the other hand, is an allergic reaction to the proteins present in milk.</p>\n\n\n"
